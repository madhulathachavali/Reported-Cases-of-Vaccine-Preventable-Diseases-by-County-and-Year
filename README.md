## Vaccine-Preventable Diseases Trends in California 2024


This dataset, sourced from data.gov and updated on May 14, 2024, includes counts of vaccine-preventable disease cases among California residents by county, disease, and year. It has four variables: Disease (the name of the disease), County (the name of the county), Year (the year the cases were reported), and Count (the number of reported cases). Extracted from California Confidential Morbidity Reports and Laboratory Reports, this data, maintained by the CDPH, is essential for analyzing trends in vaccine-preventable diseases across California.


### Counties with highest number of diseases

Excluding California, the top five counties with the highest total disease counts are:

1. Los Angeles: 15,420 cases

2. San Diego: 11,555 cases

3. Orange: 3,853 cases

4. Santa Clara: 3,690 cases
